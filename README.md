   # Installation: 
   The following must be installed to run the application properly: to generate your own team profile generator, you have to first create your own repository and clone it locally. Then run npm install in order to install the npm package (express and package.JSON). Now the application will be able to run node index.js in the command line. After you have input your questions within your js files they should appear in the command line for you to answer and automatically generate a profile for each employee added.
